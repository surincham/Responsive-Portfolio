            Hello, welcome to my portfolio. My name is Surin Cham. I am currently attending DU for the Full Stack Programming program. I originally started school at CCA to pursue computer programming.
            I then later switched major to Computer Information System. A few semesters into CIS, I realized that I miss programming. That is where I found the Full Stack Programming program at DU.

            The excitement that I get in creating things from scratch is amazing. To see a blank canvas being created is an amazing thing to witness. Since I've started, I've been thinking of lots of ways to be creative.
            With the knowledge that I will get from DU. I will soon be able to turn my visions into a reality. I can't wait to learn the ropes of being a Full Stack Developer.  
        </p>

        <p>
            Cheers to the next 24 weeks of learning!
